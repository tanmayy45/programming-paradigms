<h2><u>Definition</u></h2>

<h3>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming,[citation needed] based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages appeared circa 1957–1964, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, PL/I and BASIC.[1] Pascal and C were published circa 1970–1972.

Computer processors provide hardware support for procedural programming through a stack register and instructions for calling procedures and returning from them. Hardware support for other types of programming is possible, but no attempt was commercially successful (for example Lisp machines or Java processors).[contradictory]

<h2><u>Procedures and modularity</u></h2>


<h3>Modularity is generally desirable, especially in large, complicated programs. Inputs are usually specified syntactically in the form of arguments and the outputs delivered as return values.

Scoping is another technique that helps keep procedures modular. It prevents the procedure from accessing the variables of other procedures (and vice versa), including previous instances of itself, without explicit authorization.

Less modular procedures, often used in small or quickly written programs, tend to interact with a large number of variables in the execution environment, which other procedures might also modify.

Because of the ability to specify a simple interface, to be self-contained, and to be reused, procedures are a convenient vehicle for making pieces of code written by different people or different groups, including through programming libraries.</h3>

<h2><u>Comparison with other programming paradigms
</u></h2>

<h3>Procedural programming languages are also imperative languages, because they make explicit references to the state of the execution environment. This could be anything from variables (which may correspond to processor registers) to something like the position of the "turtle" in the Logo programming language.</h3>

<h3>The focus of procedural programming is to break down a programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines.</h3>

<h3>The principles of modularity and code reuse in practical functional languages are fundamentally the same as in procedural languages, since they both stem from structured programming. So for example:

Procedures correspond to functions. Both allow the reuse of the same code in various parts of the programs, and at various points of its execution.
By the same token, procedure calls correspond to function application.
Functions and their invocations are modularly separated from each other in the same manner, by the use of function arguments, return values and variable scopes.</h3>

<h3>In logic programming, a program is a set of premises, and computation is performed by attempting to prove candidate theorems. From this point of view, logic programs are declarative, focusing on what the problem is, rather than on how to solve it.

However, the backward reasoning technique, implemented by SLD resolution, used to solve problems in logic programming languages such as Prolog, treats programs as goal-reduction procedures. Thus clauses of the form:</h3>

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
int main() 
{ 
	int i, fact = 1, num; 
	cout << "Enter any Number: "; 
	cin >> number; 
	for (i = 1; i <= num; i++) { 
		fact = fact * i; 
	} 
	cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is: " << fact << endl; 
	return 0; 
}
