<h2><u>Definition</u></h2>

<h3>
In computer programming, symbolic programming is a programming paradigm in which the program can manipulate its own formulas and program components as if they were plain data.[1]

Through symbolic programming, complex processes can be developed that build other more intricate processes by combining smaller units of logic or functionality. Thus, such programs can effectively modify themselves and appear to "learn", which makes them better suited for applications such as artificial intelligence, expert systems, natural language processing, and computer games.

Languages that support symbolic programming include homoiconic languages such as Wolfram Language,[2] LISP and Prolog.[3]</h3>

<h2><u>
Symbolic language (programming)
</u></h2>


<h3>
In computer science, a symbolic language is a language that uses characters or symbols to represent concepts, such as mathematical operations and the entities (or operands) on which these operations are performed.[1]

Modern programming languages use symbols to represent concepts and/or data and are therefore, examples of symbolic languages.[1]

Some programming languages (such as Lisp and Mathematica) make it easy to represent higher-level abstractions as expressions in the language, enabling symbolic programming.[2], [3]

<h2><u>Symbol table

</u></h2>

<h3>


In computer science, a symbol table is a data structure used by a language translator such as a compiler or interpreter, where each identifier (a.k.a. symbol) in a program's source code is associated with information relating to its declaration or appearance in the source. In other words, the entries of a symbol table store the information related to the entry's corresponding symbol.

<h2><u>Example</u></h2>

<h3>


extern double bar(double x);

// Define a public function
double foo(int count)
{
    double sum = 0.0;

    // Sum all the values bar(1) to bar(count)
    for (int i = 1; i <= count; i++)
        sum += bar((double) i);
    return sum;
}
